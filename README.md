# Hello-world
Franklin's Repository
My name is Franklin, and my current major is GIST. I am married with two kids and a chocolate labrador. My hobbies are working out, reading, and spending time with my family. I hope to get a better understanding of Open Source GIS out of this class and identify some of the tools that I will use as a GIS Professional.
